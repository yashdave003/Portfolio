Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for dropping by.

### Who Are You?

I'm Yash. I study [applied math](https://math.berkeley.edu/programs/undergraduate/major/applied) and [data science](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/data-science/) at UC Berkeley with a minor in [public policy](http://guide.berkeley.edu/undergraduate/degree-programs/public-policy/).
