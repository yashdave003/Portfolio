Throughout 2022, I worked under Livia Alfonsi, a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, on the Meet Your Future Project as a research apprentice. I performed sentiment analysis and emotion detection using the VADER and NRC dictionary on the 500+ interview dataset, creating visualizations using ggplot2. Separately, using [zero-shot classification](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli), I developed a [topic modelling pipeline](https://github.com/yashdave003/URAP) to classify topics into either information, strategy, motivation or neutral. Besides those two tasks, I conducted a couple literature reviews to explore other studies in development economics, visualized some supporting data for the paper, and copy-edited manuscripts.
