Over the spring semester in 2022, I interned at [modelwise.ai](https://modelwise.ai/) in Berkeley, California through the Skydeck ACE intern program. I engaged in competitor analysis within the hardware product life-cycle management and safety engineering sector. By developing a pricing strategy for an integrated certification marketplace model, I helped build a case for the role of modelwise as middleware connecting manufacturers, industry partners and compliance bodies.
